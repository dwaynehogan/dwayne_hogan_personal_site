        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          A systematic approach to SEO that treats it as an operational discipline—not a one-time project. This framework turns scattered optimization efforts into a repeatable monthly playbook backed by executive-level dashboards.
        </p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Most SEO efforts fail because they lack structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reactive firefighting</strong> — Chasing rankings drops without a systematic response</li>
          <li><strong>No visibility</strong> — Leadership can't see what's working or what needs attention</li>
          <li><strong>Inconsistent execution</strong> — SEO happens when someone has time, not on a cadence</li>
          <li><strong>Wasted effort</strong> — Optimizing the wrong pages while high-impact opportunities sit idle</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Solution: The Monthly SEO Playbook</h2>
        <p>
          A systematic framework that runs monthly "plays" based on performance data. Instead of random optimization, you execute specific tactics triggered by specific conditions.
        </p>

        <h3>The Six Plays</h3>

        <p><strong>Play 1: Rankings Recovery</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>Trigger:</em> A tracked keyword has dropped in rankings.<br>
          <em>Objective:</em> Recover lost rankings through systematic optimization—internal linking, meta tag refresh, content updates, FAQ sections.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Play 2: Content Rewrite for Non-Ranking Pages</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>Trigger:</em> A page is not ranking in the top 30 for its target keyword.<br>
          <em>Objective:</em> Complete strategic rewrite to establish ranking potential.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Play 3: Striking Distance Optimization</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>Trigger:</em> Keyword ranking in positions 4-10.<br>
          <em>Objective:</em> Push into top 3 for significantly higher CTR. Small improvements here yield massive traffic gains.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Play 4: Page 2 to Page 1 Promotion</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>Trigger:</em> Keyword ranking in positions 11-20.<br>
          <em>Objective:</em> Break onto page 1 (page 2 gets less than 1% of clicks). Strategic internal linking and content depth expansion.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Play 5: Top Page Amplification</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>Trigger:</em> Page identified as top performer (top 20% driving 80% of results).<br>
          <em>Objective:</em> Maximize value by using top pages to lift other pages through strategic internal linking.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Play 6: Re-Index Deindexed Pages</strong></p>
        <p>
          <em>Trigger:</em> Page not indexed in Google.<br>
          <em>Objective:</em> Get the page indexed through Search Console submission, redirects, or full rewrites.
        </p>

        <h2>The Command View Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
          A monthly executive dashboard that provides complete visibility into SEO performance:
        </p>

        <h3>Rankings Overview</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Keywords in Top 3</li>
          <li>Keywords in Top 10</li>
          <li>Keywords on Page 2 (opportunity)</li>
          <li>Keywords not ranking (risk)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Traffic Metrics</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Organic sessions (total and by objective)</li>
          <li>Organic conversions (demo requests, signups)</li>
          <li>Top landing pages</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Content Performance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>New pages published</li>
          <li>Pages optimized</li>
          <li>Plays executed and results</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Monthly Actions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rankings declines to address (Play 1)</li>
          <li>Striking distance opportunities (Play 3)</li>
          <li>Page 2 promotion candidates (Play 4)</li>
          <li>Top pages to amplify (Play 5)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why This Works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Data-driven decisions</strong> — Every action is triggered by performance data, not guesswork</li>
          <li><strong>Systematic execution</strong> — Monthly cadence ensures consistent progress</li>
          <li><strong>Executive visibility</strong> — Leadership can see exactly what's working and what's not</li>
          <li><strong>Focus on leverage</strong> — Effort goes where it has the highest impact</li>
          <li><strong>Repeatable process</strong> — New team members can execute the playbook without tribal knowledge</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          This operational approach transforms SEO from a mysterious art into a predictable engine:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faster recovery</strong> from rankings drops</li>
          <li><strong>Higher conversion rates</strong> as pages move from position 5 to position 1</li>
          <li><strong>Better resource allocation</strong> by focusing on high-leverage opportunities</li>
          <li><strong>Increased confidence</strong> from leadership seeing clear metrics and progress</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>
          Continuing to refine the playbook:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>AI-assisted play execution for faster turnaround</li>
          <li>Predictive analytics to identify opportunities before they become problems</li>
          <li>Automated alerts for play triggers</li>
          <li>Enhanced dashboard visualizations for pattern recognition</li>
        </ul>
