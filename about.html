      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p style="font-size: 1.25rem; color: var(--color-text); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        I'm a marketing strategist and creative thinker passionate about the intersection
        of creativity, personal development, and strategic marketing.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I help brands and organizations develop marketing strategies that resonate with
        their audiences through a combination of SEO expertise, content marketing, and
        creative problem-solving. My approach blends data-driven insights with human-centered
        storytelling to create campaigns that drive meaningful engagement.
      </p>

      <h2>My Interests</h2>

      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      <p>
        I believe creativity isn't just about artistic expression—it's a mindset that
        can be applied to problem-solving, strategy, and everyday life. I'm constantly
        exploring new ways to enhance creative thinking and build systems that support it.
      </p>

      <h3>Personal Development</h3>
      <p>
        Continuous learning and growth are central to everything I do. Whether it's
        developing new skills, building better habits, or exploring frameworks for
        productivity, I'm committed to becoming better every day.
      </p>

      <h3>Marketing & SEO</h3>
      <p>
        With deep expertise in content marketing and SEO, I focus on creating strategies
        that drive organic growth, build brand authority, and deliver measurable results.
        I'm particularly interested in the evolving landscape of search and how to create
        content that serves both users and search engines.
      </p>

      <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
