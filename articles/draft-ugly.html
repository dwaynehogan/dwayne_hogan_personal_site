          Why Bad Work Is The Key To Being A Prolific Creator
        </p>

      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          You've been looking for the thing that's stopping you. The block. The fear. The Resistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          You've read the books. You've bought the tools. You've taken the courses. You've tried every framework, every system, every hack. And none of it worked — because all of it was built on a lie.
        </p>

        <p>
          The lie is that Resistance is something outside you. A dark force. An ancient enemy. Something you fight, push through, overcome.
        </p>

        <p>
          But if Resistance is external, why does it know exactly where you're weak? Why does it follow you from project to project, year to year, tool to tool?
        </p>

        <p>
          Because it's not outside you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>You are Resistance.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Not because you're broken. Not because you're lazy. But because identity is built through action — and you've spent years taking the wrong ones. Every course instead of drafting. Every plan instead of starting. Every "tomorrow" instead of today. You weren't preparing. You were becoming.
        </p>

        <p>
          And what you became is the thing that's stopping you.
        </p>

        <p>
          You've been practicing the Religion of Ready. Waiting to be saved. Waiting for clarity. Waiting until it's good enough. But readiness is Resistance wearing a responsible mask. And consumption is its sacrament — every book, every course, every tool is communion at the wrong altar.
        </p>

        <p>
          The way out is heresy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Draft something bad. Draft it today. That's the blasphemy that sets you free.
        </p>

        <p>
          A bad draft isn't a step toward a good draft. It's more valuable than a good draft — because it's proof you're becoming someone else.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every draft, no matter how ugly, is a vote for the creator. Every blank canvas is a vote for Resistance. You've been voting the same way for years. And you're winning the wrong election.
        </p>

        <p>
          No one's coming to save you.
        </p>

        <p>
          No framework. No book. No mentor. No moment of clarity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just you. And what you draft. Or don't.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can stay Resistance forever. That's also a choice. You can die as the enemy. No one will stop you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Or you can draft ugly. Today. And start becoming someone new.
